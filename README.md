# Recipe-app

* The project consists of search input and a search button. The user enters the dish name of his choice into this input and hits the search button. When the user clicks on the search button, it displays an image of the respective meal, its name, and the country of origin.
* Along with this, we also show a list of ingredients along with the measure. Next to the ingredients, we have a ‘View Recipe’ button. When the user clicks on this button, a pop-up opens up with instructions for cooking the meal.
